# Formula-1-Drivers-Champion-Prediction---Logistic-Regression
Classification Analysis and Probability Prediction of Formula 1 top 100 drivers
This model is a logistic regression analysis of a dataset of the top 100 Formula 1 drivers of all time.  The classification is based on labes of "is champion" or "is not champion". The model.predict_proba method was utilized to predict the probabilities associated with the classification.  The model only has a training set of data but over time as we get more historical data a test set can be built to test the accuracy of the model.
