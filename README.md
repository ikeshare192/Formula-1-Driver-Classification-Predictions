# Formula-1-Drivers-Champion-Prediction---Logistic-Regression
This model is a classification analysis with probability prediction of Formula 1's top 100 drivers.  The classification is based on labes of "is champion" or "is not champion". The model.predict_proba method was utilized to predict the probabilities associated with the classification.  The model only has a training set of data but over time as we get more historical data a test set can be built to test the accuracy of the model.
